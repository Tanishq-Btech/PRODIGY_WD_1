# PRODIGY_WD_1
This project is part of my web development internship at Prodigy Infotech. It demonstrates an interactive and responsive navigation menu built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu remains fixed on the screen, changes style on scroll, and responds visually when hovering over items.
